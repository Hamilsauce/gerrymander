# `Gerrymander'd`

## BIG IDEA

The game is inspired by the way modern U.S. politics—especially around redistricting—has shifted from persuading voters to structurally managing them. As gerrymandering becomes more explicit and aggressive, the electorate stops functioning as active participants and instead becomes population mass to be partitioned, isolated, and locked out. What was once an occasional, technical process turns into a permanent arms race over map control, where winning is less about popular support and more about preventing the opposition from ever assembling power again.

The core concept of the game is to let players operate inside that logic and then confront its consequences. Players compete to secure structural dominance by locking in states, but doing so generates latent pressure from excluded factions that cannot express themselves through normal political channels. The game is built around the idea that entrenchment doesn’t eliminate opposition—it defers it. By splitting play into an initial phase of competitive structural capture and a later phase where suppressed pressure erupts into open conflict, the game explores a central question: whether it’s possible to win a system by exclusion without eventually destabilizing the system itself.

## GAME OVERVIEW

* Players: 3–6
* Map: Full U.S., 50 states
* Each state contains **3–5 sub-state regions** (“district blocks”) with **population weights**
* Game has **two phases**

---

## PHASE 1 — ELECTORAL COMPETITION + STRUCTURAL CAPTURE

### State Structure

* Each state has:

  * Total population weight
  * Multiple district blocks (each with weight)
* Controlling **≥50% of a state’s population weight** = electoral majority (not locked)

---

### Turn Actions (Phase 1)

On your turn, choose **one**:

1. **Contest District**

   * Target an uncontrolled or opponent-controlled district block
   * Roll dice + modifiers (influence, adjacency, momentum)
   * If successful, gain control of that district’s weight

2. **Attempt Gerrymander (Lock State)** *(only if you hold ≥50% weight)*

   * Make a gerrymander roll
   * Success chance depends on:

     * % population weight you control
     * Adjacent locked states (bonus)
     * Force level chosen (soft / hard / brutal)
   * On success:

     * State becomes **locked**
     * No further district contests allowed there in Phase 1
     * Locked-out factions begin accumulating pressure
   * On failure:

     * State remains contested
     * Pressure still increases
     * Gerrymander cooldown applies

3. **Pressure Relief**

   * Reduce pressure growth in one state
   * Costs tempo (no expansion this turn)

---

### Force Levels (used in contests and gerrymanders)

* **Soft**: low pressure, low reliability
* **Hard**: moderate pressure, reliable
* **Brutal**: high pressure, high reliability

---

### Pressure (Phase 1)

* Pressure is tracked **per state per faction**
* Generated when:

  * A faction loses districts
  * A state is gerrymandered against them
* Thin or aggressive gerrymanders generate pressure faster
* Pressure does nothing immediately

---

### Phase 1 End Condition

* One player locks a **dominant share of national population weight**
* Other players cannot realistically contest dominance
* That player becomes **the Regime**

---

## PHASE 2 — INSURGENCY AND COLLAPSE

### Role Shift

* Regime: 1 player
* All others become **factions**
* Map state does not reset

---

### Pressure Conversion

* All accumulated pressure converts into **insurgency units**
* Insurgency strength scales with:

  * Amount of pressure
  * Force used during gerrymandering
  * Population weight of the state

---

### Phase 2 Turn Structure

Each round:

1. **Factions act**
2. **Regime responds**

---

### Faction Actions

* Attack adjacent regions
* Reinforce insurgencies
* Sabotage regime capacity

Factions do not fight each other.

---

### Regime Actions

* Suppress insurgency
* Move forces
* Fortify states
* Concede autonomy (reduces pressure, weakens control)

Brutal suppression removes insurgents but creates new latent pressure.

---

### Territory Loss

* If key population regions fall, the entire state flips
* Losing enough states ends regime dominance

---

## WIN CONDITIONS

### Regime Wins If:

* Survives Phase 2 for X rounds
* Maintains national dominance
* Insurgency below collapse threshold

### Factions Win If:

* Regime loses dominance
* National cohesion collapses
* Insurgency exceeds regime capacity

---

## CORE MECHANICAL PRINCIPLES

* District control ≠ state control
* State control ≠ stability
* Gerrymandering trades short-term security for long-term instability
* Pressure is deferred, not avoided
* Phase 1 decisions fully determine Phase 2 difficulty
